# Pixel Paint
_By setghm 2024_

The main goal of the application is to provide an easy way to create Windows console, game sprites.

Save your creations as .spr, read the 2 first 32 bit integer values as the width and height (in that order), then the rest of the unsigned bytes data are the pixels of the actual image. You can save that on an array.

This is a Visual C++ project.
